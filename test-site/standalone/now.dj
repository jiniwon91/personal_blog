This is my [now page][] where I try to lay out what I'm focusing on right now.
The point is the *big picture* and should only include things that you'd say to a friend you haven't seen in a year.

# Books

At the moment I'm completely sold on fantasy and I can't get enough of them.
I'm currently reading Dungeon Crawler Carl and it's _fantastic_.

# Projects

I'm always working on different projects, often jumping between projects before finishing them.

As a general theme though I've spent most of my time recently with 3D printing things to build, going deeper into Neovim and its Lua API, and writing (or procrastinating by working on writing tools such as this blog).
